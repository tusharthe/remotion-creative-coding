# Python Master Class: Episode 1 - Voiceover Subtitles

Here are the subtitles extracted from your script for manual recording:

## Scene 1: Introduction & The Hook
"Welcome to the Python Master Class. Whether you want to build web apps, dive into data science, or train the next big AI model, it all starts right here. Python is the world's most dominant programming language, known for its elegant, readable syntax. It actually started as a hobby project by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and was named after Monty Python's Flying Circus—not the snake!"

## Scene 2: Why Python? & Applications
"Why should you learn Python? First, it's incredibly easy to learn with an English-like syntax. It's interpreted, meaning no compiling, and dynamically typed. It has 'batteries included'—meaning its standard library is huge. And what can you build? Everything. From backend web servers and desktop apps to massive Machine Learning models."

## Scene 3: Installation & The Interactive Shell
"To get started, simply download Python from python.org. Make sure you check 'Add Python to PATH' during installation. Once installed, you can open your terminal and type `python` to enter the interactive shell."

"The shell is perfect for testing quick logic and doing math on the fly."

## Scene 4: Your First Program & Syntax Rules
"But for real projects, you'll save your code in files with a `.py` extension. And when writing Python, there are a few golden rules: It is case-sensitive, statements simply end at the line break—no nasty semicolons required—and most importantly, indentation matters."

"Python uses indentation (typically 4 spaces) to define code blocks instead of curly braces. If you mix tabs and spaces, or forget to indent, your code will crash."

## Scene 5: Comments & Keywords Wrap-up
"To leave notes for yourself or other developers, use the hash symbol for single-line comments, or triple quotes for multi-line explanations. Finally, keep in mind there are reserved keywords in Python—like `if`, `for`, `def`, `class`, `True`, and `False`—that you cannot use as variable names."

## Scene 6: Outro
"And that's your first taste of Python. In the next chapter, we're going to dive into Variables and Data Types. Make sure to subscribe, and I'll see you there!"
