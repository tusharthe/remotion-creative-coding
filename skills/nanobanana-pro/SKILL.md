## When to use

Use this skill when you need high-quality, consistent image assets for your coding videos, thumbnails, or UI backgrounds.

## Key Features

- **Character Consistency**: Maintain the same character or style across multiple generated images.
- **Studio Quality**: Generate 4K, high-fidelity images for professional video backgrounds.
- **Sharp Text Rendering**: Ideal for generating UI mockups or posters with readable text.
- **Multi-step Editing**: Use natural language to edit specific parts of a generated image.

## Creative Workflows

### 1. Generating Video Backgrounds
1. **Prompt**: "A futuristic workspace with glass monitors, soft purple neon lighting, 4k cinema style."
2. **Refine**: Use Nano Banana Pro's editing to add specific code on the monitors.

### 2. Creating Consistent Avatars
- Use the character reference feature to create an AI presenter that looks the same in every frame.

### 3. UI Asset Creation
- Generate beautiful, custom icons or window backgrounds that fit your video's color palette.

## Best Practices

- **Detailed Prompts**: Be specific about lighting, camera angle, and artistic style (e.g., "Photorealistic", "Cyberpunk", "Minimalist").
- **AspectRatio**: Match the aspect ratio to your Remotion composition (e.g., 16:9 for YouTube).
- **Iteration**: Use multi-step editing to tweak assets instead of starting from scratch.
