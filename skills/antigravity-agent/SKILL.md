## When to use

Use this skill to leverage the full power of the Antigravity agent for autonomous task completion, complex refactoring, and deep workspace analysis.

## Core Philosophies

1. **Gemini 3.1 Pro Powered**: Antigravity is built on the latest Gemini 3.1 Pro model, enabling superior reasoning, larger context awareness (1M+ tokens), and complex multi-step problem solving.
2. **Autonomous Execution**: Antigravity doesn't just suggest code; it executes it, verifies it, and polishes it.
3. **Proactive Debugging**: If a build fails, Antigravity identifies the root cause and fixes it automatically.

## Agentic Workflows

### 1. Feature Implementation
- **Analyze**: Read existing patterns.
- **Plan**: Create an implementation plan.
- **Execute**: Write the code across multiple files.
- **Verify**: Run tests and verify the UI.

### 2. Video Pipeline Automation
- **Orchestration**: Automate the process from script generation (Gemini) to asset creation (Nano Banana Pro) to final render (Remotion).

## Best Practices

- **Clear Intent**: Provide high-level goals; Antigravity handles the low-level details.
- **Iterative Feedback**: Review Antigravity's progress at key milestones.
- **Tool Usage**: Trust Antigravity to use the right tool (grep, find, write, run) for the job.
